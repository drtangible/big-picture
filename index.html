        Jam your content up in here. Don't be shy. Throw some shit in here and customize it as you see fit. Really, have your way with it. I don't really care what you put in here, just make sure it's not some dumb "lorem ipsum" placeholder copy.

        Look how dumb that shit looks. <b>Look at it.</b> For the love of all that is good, <a href="https://github.com/drtangible/big-picture">fork this repo</a> and build a page that doesn't subject people to that antiquated language. People don't even speak Latin anymore.

        After you add some cool stuff, make it all pretty-like in <code>css/styles.css</code>. Maybe you could add an alert in <code>js/index.js</code>. I don't really care. Copy in your own <code>img/bg.png</code> and you don't have to look at that super magnificent church any longer.
